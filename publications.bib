   abstract = {Sex differences are well known in cerebral ischemia and may impact the effect of stroke treatments. In male rats, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 reduces ischemia-induced endothelin type B (ETB) receptor upregulation, infarct size and improves acute neurologic function after experimental stroke. However, responses to this treatment in females and long-term effects on outcome are not known. Initial experiments used in vitro organ culture of cerebral arteries, confirming ERK1/2 activation and increased ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in female cerebral arteries. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO, 120 minutes) was induced in female Wistar rats, with U0126 (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle administered at 0 and 24 hours of reperfusion, or with no treatment. Infarct volumes were determined and neurologic function was assessed by 6-point and 28-point neuroscores. ETB receptor-mediated contraction was studied with myograph and protein expression with immunohistochemistry. In vitro organ culture and tMCAO resulted in vascular ETB receptor upregulation and activation of ERK1/2 that was prevented by U0126. Although no effect on infarct size, U0126 improved the long-term neurologic function after experimental stroke in female rats. In conclusion, early prevention of the ERK1/2 activation and ETB receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature after ischemic stroke in female rats improves the long-term neurologic outcome.},

   abstract = {A recent study suggests that patients with persistent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) following treatment with recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) have better outcomes than patients with MCA occlusion not receiving rt-PA. We performed a study to elucidate possible mechanisms of this finding in a new model of thromboembolic stroke closely mimicking human pathophysiology.|Thromboembolic stroke was induced by local injection of thrombin directly into the right MCA of C57 black/6J mice. Rt-PA was administered 20 and 40 min after clot formation. The efficiency of rt-PA to induce thrombolysis was measured by laser Doppler. After 24 h, all animals were euthanized and interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, Caspase-3, hsp 32 and hsp 70 protein levels were investigated by immunofluorescence. Presence of hemorrhage was verified and infarct volume was measured using histology.|Thrombin injection resulted in clot formation giving rise to cortical brain infarction. Early rt-PA treatment starting at 20 min after the clot formation resulted in 100% recanalization. However, rt-PA-induced thrombolysis dissolved the clot in only 38% of the animals when administered 40 min after clot formation. Protein levels of IL-6, TNF-α, MMP-9, Caspase-3, hsp 32 and hsp 70 were increased after MCAO, whereas treatment with rt-PA attenuated the expressions of inflammatory markers in those animals where the thrombolysis was successful. In addition, the infarct size was significantly reduced with rt-PA treatment compared to non-treated MCAO, regardless of whether MCA thrombolysis was successful.|The present study demonstrates a clear correlation of the protein expression of inflammatory mediators, apoptosis and stress genes with the recanalization data after rt-PA treatment. In this model rt-PA treatment decreases the infarct size regardless of whether vessel recanalization is successful.},

   abstract = {This study characterizes a new model of thromboembolic stroke of the middle cerebral artery in C57 black/6J mice, thus offering an opportunity to use the model for studying ischemic stroke in transgenic mice. Thromboembolic stroke was induced by local injection of either 1.5 or 3.0 UI of thrombin directly into the right MCA of C57 black/6J mice. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) velocity was measured continuously by laser Doppler flowmetry, which allowed documentation of both MCA occlusion and of spontaneous recanalization. After 24 h, all animals were euthanized. Cryosections were cut at 400-μm intervals and silver stained with the high-contrast method for volumetric assessment of infarct size. Interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), caspase-3 and hsp 70 protein levels were investigated by immunofluorescence. Thrombin injection resulted in clot formation in all animals. Cortical infarction occurred in 63% of the mice while 37% had a spontaneous MCA recanalization during the first 20 min following thrombin injection. In cases of successful MCA occlusion with consequent infarction, the clot was stable up to 2 h after formation. Subsequently, 20% recanalized spontaneously. Infarctions were restricted to the cortex with a mean lesion volume of 36 ± 5 for 1.5 UI and 56 ± 8 for 3.0 UI thrombin. Protein levels of IL-6, TNF-α, caspase-3, and hsp 70 were significantly increased after MCAO. The results demonstrate that the mouse thromboembolic stroke model produces cortical infarctions of consistent size in C57 black/6J mice, which is dependent upon the amount of thrombin used for clot formation. Spontaneous MCA recanalization occurs after 2 h of ischemia in 20% of mice. Thus, the thromboembolic model is an applicable stroke model for C57 black/6J mice, which mimics many of the features of human stroke, including spontaneous recanalization. However, strain differences between Swiss and C57 black/6J mice must be taken into account when using the model.},

   abstract = {The pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia associated with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) still remains elusive. The aim of this study was to examine the involvement of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) subtypes in the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia after SAH in cerebral arteries and microvessels and to examine temporal activation of the kinases. We hypothesize that treatment with a MAPK or PKC inhibitor will prevent the SAH-induced kinase activation in brain vessels.|SAH was induced by injecting 250 microL blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in the rat. The activation of different MAPK and PKC isotypes in large circle of Willis cerebral arteries and intracerebral microvessels was examined at 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours after SAH and after intrathecal treatment with PKC or MAPK inhibitor by use of Western blot.|Among the 8 investigated PKC isoforms, only PKC delta was activated at 1 hour and at 48 hours, whereas PKC alpha was activated at 48 hours after SAH. For the MAPKs, there was early phosphorylation at 1 hour of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, whereas c-jun N-terminal kinase and p38 showed enhanced phosphorylation only at 48 hours after SAH. The pattern was identical in large cerebral arteries and in intracerebral microvessels. Treatment with either the PKC (RO-31-7549) or the raf (SB386023-b) inhibitor prevented the kinase activation.|The results show that specific subtypes of the MAPK and PKC pathways are activated in cerebral arteries after SAH and the PKC and raf inhibitors are able to prevent this activation.},

   abstract = {Cerebral ischemia remains the key cause of disability and death in the late phase after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and its pathogenesis is still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the change in intracranial pressure or the extravasated blood causes the late cerebral ischemia and the upregulation of receptors or the cerebral vasoconstriction observed following SAH.|Rats were allocated to 1 of 3 experimental conditions: 1) cisternal injection of 250 microl blood (SAH Group), 2) cisternal injection of 250 microl NaCl (Saline Group), or 3) the same procedure but without fluid injection (Sham Group). Two days after the procedure, the basilar and middle cerebral arteries were harvested, and contractile responses to endothelin (ET)-1 and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) were investigated by means of myography. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the mRNA levels for ET(A), ET(B), and 5-HT(1) receptors. Regional and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) were quantified by means of an autoradiographic technique.|Compared with the sham condition, both SAH and saline injection resulted in significantly enhanced contraction of cerebral arteries in response to ET-1 and 5-CT. Regional and global CBF were reduced both in the Saline and SAH groups compared with the Sham Group. The mRNA levels for ET(B) and 5-HT(1B) receptors were upregulated after SAH and saline injection compared with the sham procedure. The effects in all parameters were more pronounced for SAH than for saline injection.|This study revealed that both the elevation of intracranial pressure and subarachnoid blood per se contribute approximately equally to the late CBF reductions and receptor upregulation following SAH.},

   abstract = {Cerebral ischemia results in enhanced expression of contractile cerebrovascular receptors, such as endothelin type B (ET(B)), 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1B (5-HT(1B)), angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) and thromboxane (TP) receptors in the cerebral arteries within the ischemic area. The receptor upregulation occurs via activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. Previous studies have shown that inhibitors of the MAPK pathway diminished the ischemic area and contractile cerebrovascular receptors after experimental cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to examine if the upregulation of contractile cerebrovascular receptors after 48 h of organ culture of human cerebral arteries involves MAPK pathways and if it can be prevented by a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Human cerebral arteries were obtained from patients undergoing intracranial tumor surgery. The vessels were divided into ring segments and incubated for 48 h in the presence or absence of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. The vessels were then examined by using in vitro pharmacological methods and protein immunohistochemistry.|After organ culture of the cerebral arteries the contractile responses to endothelin (ET)-1, angiotensin (Ang) II and thromboxane (TP) were enhanced in comparison with fresh human arteries. However, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) induced decreased contractile responses after organ culture as compared to fresh arteries. Incubation with U0126 diminished the maximum contraction elicited by application of ET-1, Ang II and U46619 in human cerebral arteries. In addition, the MEK1/2 inhibitor decreased the contractile response to 5-CT. Immunohistochemistry revealed that organ culture resulted in increased expression of endothelin ET(A), endothelin ET(B) angiotensin AT(2), 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT(1B) and thromboxane A2 receptors, and elevated levels of activated pERK1/2, all localized to the smooth muscle cells of the cerebral arteries. Co-incubation with U0126 normalized these proteins.|The study demonstrated that there is a clear association between human cerebrovascular receptor upregulation via transcription involving activation of the MAPK pathway after organ culture. Inhibition of the MAPK pathways attenuated the vasoconstriction mediated by ET, AT and TP receptors in human cerebral arteries and the enhanced expression of their receptors. The results indicate that MAPK inhibition might be a novel target for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders.},

   abstract = {Late cerebral ischemia carries high morbidity and mortality after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) due to reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the subsequent cerebral ischemia which is associated with upregulation of contractile receptors in the vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signal pathway. We hypothesize that SAH initiates cerebrovascular ERK1/2 activation, resulting in receptor upregulation. The raf inhibitor will inhibit the molecular events upstream ERK1/2 and may provide a therapeutic window for treatment of cerebral ischemia after SAH.|Here we demonstrate that SAH increases the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in cerebral vessels and reduces the neurology score in rats in additional with the CBF measured by an autoradiographic method. The intracisternal administration of SB-386023-b, a specific inhibitor of raf, given 6 h after SAH, aborts the receptor changes and protects the brain from the development of late cerebral ischemia at 48 h. This is accompanied by reduced phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cerebrovascular SMC. SAH per se enhances contractile responses to endothelin-1 (ET-1), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and angiotensin II (Ang II), upregulates ETB, 5-HT1B and AT1 receptor mRNA and protein levels. Treatment with SB-386023-b given as late as at 6 h but not at 12 h after the SAH significantly decreased the receptor upregulation, the reduction in CBF and the neurology score.|These results provide evidence for a role of the ERK1/2 pathway in regulation of expression of cerebrovascular SMC receptors. It is suggested that raf inhibition may reduce late cerebral ischemia after SAH and provides a realistic time window for therapy.},

   abstract = {Cerebral vasospasm following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) leads to reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and to cerebral ischemia, in some cases even producing infarction and long-term disability. The goal of the present study was to investigate the hypothesis that inhibition of neurokinin-1 receptors (NK1Rs) by administration of L-822429 blunts the decrease in CBF as well as cerebrovascular receptor upregulation in an animal model of SAH.|Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced in rats by injection of 250 microl of blood into the prechiasmatic cistern. The NK1R inhibitor L-822429 was injected intracisternally 30 minutes and 24 hours after the induction of SAH. Two days after SAH induction, the basilar arteries were harvested, and contractile responses to endothelin-1 (ET-I, an ETA- and ETB-receptor agonist) and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (a 5-hydroxytryptamine- I1 [5-HT1]-receptor agonist) were investigated using sensitive myographs. To determine whether NKIR inhibition had an influence on local CBF after post-SAH, a quantitative autoradiographic technique was used. After SAH, the vascular receptor phenotype was changed in cerebral arteries through upregulation of contractile ET, and 5-HT1B receptors, while regional and total CBF were markedly reduced. Treatment with the selective NK1R inhibitor L-822429 prevented both the receptor upregulation and the reduction in regional and global CBF.|The data reveal the coregulation of vascular receptor changes and blood flow effects, and also show that interaction with a small-molecule NK1R antagonist is a promising area of focus for the development of specific treatments for SAH.},

Our aim is to correlate the upregulation of cerebrovascular receptors and the underlying molecular mechanisms with the reduction in regional and global cerebral blood flow (CBF) after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). SAH was induced by injecting 250 microl blood into the prechiasmatic cistern in rats. The cerebral arteries were removed 0, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h after the SAH for functional and molecular studies. The contractile responses to ET-1, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT), and ANG II were investigated with myograph. The receptor mRNA and protein levels were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. In addition, regional and global CBFs were measured by an autoradiographic method. As a result, SAH resulted in enhanced contractions to ET-1 and 5-CT. ANG II [via ANG II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors] induced increased contractile responses [in the presence of the ANG II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor antagonist PD-123319]. In parallel the ET(B), 5-HT(1B), and AT(1) receptor, mRNA and protein levels were elevated by time. The regional and global CBF showed a successive reduction with time after SAH. In conclusion, the results demonstrate for the first time that SAH induces the upregulation of ET(B), 5-HT(1B), and AT(1) receptors in a time-dependent manner both at functional, mRNA, and protein levels. These changes occur in parallel with a successive decrease in CBF. Thus there is a temporal correlation between the changes in receptor expression and CBF reduction, suggesting a linkage.},

   abstract = {Axonal injuries commonly contribute to poor functional outcomes following traumatic brain injury (TBI). To assess cerebral blood flow (CBF) and energy metabolic disturbances in a TBI model of widespread axonal injury, we exposed 105 adult mice to the central (midline) fluid percussion injury (cFPI) diffuse TBI model, or sham injury, and used 9.4 T magnetic resonance (MR) arterial spin labeling (ASL), cortical and hippocampal mitochondrial respiration, and hippocampal MR spectroscopy at 1- and 7-days post-injury (dpi). Widespread, bilateral CBF reductions were observed at day 1 dpi, changes that were normalized by 7 dpi. However, cortical and hippocampal mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was not significantly altered at 1 and 7 dpi. Moreover, hippocampal volumes, evaluated by MRI, were not altered by cFPI, and by immunohistochemistry only a few apoptotic hippocampal cells were observed. By MRS, evidence of delayed (7 dpi) membrane disruption (phosphocholine and glycerophosphocholine) and glutamate/glutamine increase were observed. While widespread traumatic axonal pathology associated with functional impairments is observed in this TBI model, early CBF alterations were transient and did not translate into significant energy metabolic disturbances. Instead, the delayed hippocampal metabolite changes observed by MRS may contribute to the functional impairment observed in this diffuse TBI model.},

   abstract = {The recent clinical trial (DAWN) suggests that recanalization treatment may be beneficial up to 24 h after stroke onset, thus re-opening avenues for development of new therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, there is a continuous failure of drugs in clinical trials and one of the major reasons proposed for this translational roadblock is the animal models. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to validate a new thromboembolic stroke rat model that mimics the human pathology, and that can be used for evaluating new strategies to save the brain in conditions compatible with recanalization. Stroke was induced by injection of thrombin into the middle cerebral artery. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or saline was administrated at 1 h/4 h after stroke onset, and outcome was evaluated after 24 h. Induced ischemia resulted in reproducible cortical brain injuries causing a decrease in neurological function 24 h after stroke onset. Early rt-PA treatment resulted in recanalization, reduced infarct size and improved neurological functions, while late rt-PA treatment showed no beneficial effects and caused hemorrhagic transformation in 25% of the rats. This validated and established model's resemblance to human ischemic stroke and high translational potential, makes it an important tool in the development of new therapeutic strategies for stroke.},

   abstract = {Acute ischemic stroke triggers endothelial activation that disrupts vascular integrity and increases hemorrhagic transformation leading to worsened stroke outcomes. rt-PA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) is an effective treatment; however, its use is limited due to a restricted time window and hemorrhagic transformation risk, which in part may involve activation of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) mediated through LOX-1 (lectin-like oxLDL [oxidized low-density lipoprotein] receptor 1). This study's overall aim was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel MMP-9 (matrix metalloproteinase 9) ± LOX-1 inhibitors in combination with rt-PA to improve stroke outcomes.|A rat thromboembolic stroke model was utilized to investigate the impact of rt-PA delivered 4 hours poststroke onset as well as selective MMP-9 (JNJ0966) ±LOX-1 (BI-0115) inhibitors given before rt-PA administration. Infarct size, perfusion, and hemorrhagic transformation were evaluated by 9.4-T magnetic resonance imaging, vascular and parenchymal MMP-9 activity via zymography, and neurological function was assessed using sensorimotor function testing. Human brain microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia plus glucose deprivation/reperfusion (hypoxia plus glucose deprivation 3 hours/R 24 hours) and treated with ±tPA and ±MMP-9 ±LOX-1 inhibitors. Barrier function was assessed via transendothelial electrical resistance, MMP-9 activity was determined with zymography, and LOX-1 and barrier gene expression/levels were measured using qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR) and Western blot.|Stroke and subsequent rt-PA treatment increased edema, hemorrhage, MMP-9 activity, LOX-1 expression, and worsened neurological outcomes. LOX-1 inhibition improved neurological function, reduced edema, and improved endothelial barrier integrity. Elevated MMP-9 activity correlated with increased edema, infarct volume, and decreased neurological function. MMP-9 inhibition reduced MMP-9 activity and LOX-1 expression. In human brain microvascular endothelial cells, LOX-1/MMP-9 inhibition differentially attenuated MMP-9 levels, inflammation, and activation following hypoxia plus glucose deprivation/R.|Our findings indicate that LOX-1 inhibition and ± MMP-9 inhibition attenuate negative aspects of ischemic stroke with rt-PA therapy, thus resulting in improved neurological function. While no synergistic effect was observed with simultaneous LOX-1 and MMP-9 inhibition, a distinct interaction is evident.},

The neuropeptide nerve growth factor is involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation of cholinergic neurons and holds great potential in the treatment of stroke. However, as with many other compounds, the biomolecule is not able to enter the central nervous system. In the present study, nerve growth factor and ultra-small particles of iron oxide were co-encapsulated into a chemically crosslinked albumin nanocarrier matrix which was modified on the surface with apolipoprotein E. These biodegradable nanoparticles with a size of 212 ± 1 nm exhibited monodisperse size distribution and low toxicity. They delivered NGF through an artificial blood brain barrier and were able to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells in vitro. In an animal model of stroke, the infarct size was significantly reduced compared to the vehicle control. The combination therapy of NGF and the small-molecular MEK inhibitor U0126 showed a slight but not significant difference compared to U0126 alone. However, further in vivo evidence suggests that successful delivery of the neuropeptide is possible as well as the synergism between those two treatments.},

   abstract = {Tissues from males can be regulated by a balance of androgenic and estrogenic effects because of local metabolism of testosterone and expression of relevant steroid hormone receptors. As a critical first step to understanding sex hormone influences in the cerebral circulation of males, we investigated the presence of enzymes that metabolize testosterone to active products and their respective receptors. We found that cerebral blood vessels from male rats express 5alpha-reductase type 2 and aromatase, enzymes responsible for conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and 17beta-estradiol, respectively. Protein levels of these enzymes, however, were not modulated by long-term in vivo hormone treatment. We also showed the presence of receptors for both androgens (AR) and estrogens (ER) from male cerebral vessels. Western blot analysis showed bands corresponding to the full-length AR (110 kDa) and ERalpha (66 kDa). Long-term in vivo treatment of orchiectomized rats with testosterone or DHT, but not estrogen, increased AR levels in cerebral vessels. In contrast, ERalpha protein levels were increased after in vivo treatment with estrogen but not testosterone. Fluorescent immunostaining revealed ERalpha, AR, and 5alpha-reductase type 2 in both the endothelial and smooth muscle layers of cerebral arteries, whereas aromatase staining was solely localized to the endothelium. Thus, cerebral vessels from males are target tissues for both androgens and estrogen. Furthermore, local metabolism of testosterone might balance opposing androgenic and estrogenic influences on cerebrovascular as well as brain function in males.},

   abstract = {Hypertension is a hemodynamic disorder and one of the most important and well-established risk factors for vascular diseases such as stroke. Blood vessels exposed to chronic shear stress develop structural changes and remodeling of the vascular wall through many complex mechanisms. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are not fully understood. Hypertension-susceptible genes may provide a novel insight into potential molecular mechanisms of hypertension and secondary complications associated with hypertension. The aim of this exploratory study was to identify gene expression differences in the middle cerebral arteries between 12-week-old male spontaneously hypertensive rats and their normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats using an Affymetrix whole-transcriptome expression profiling. Quantitative PCR and western blotting were used to verify genes of interest. 169 genes were differentially expressed in the middle cerebral arteries from hypertensive compared to normotensive rats. The gene expression of 72 genes was decreased and the gene expression of 97 genes was increased. The following genes with a fold difference ≥1.40 were verified by quantitative PCR; Postn, Olr1, Fas, Vldlr, Mmp2, Timp1, Serpine1, Mmp11, Cd34, Ptgs1 and Ptgs2. The gene expression of Postn, Olr1, Fas, Vldlr, Mmp2, Timp1 and Serpine1 and the protein expression of LOX1 (also known as OLR1) were significantly increased in the middle cerebral arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats compared to Wistar-Kyoto rats. In conclusion, the identified genes in the middle cerebral arteries from spontaneously hypertensive rats could be possible mediators of the vascular changes and secondary complications associated with hypertension. This study supports the selection of key genes to investigate in the future research of hypertension-induced end-organ damage.},

The aim of this study was to investigate if hypertension has an effect on vasoconstrictive receptor responses to endothelin 1, sarafotoxin 6c and angiotensin II after stroke by inducing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats using the wire-myograph.

   abstract = {Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, which is one of the leading global causes of death. In the search for new and effective therapeutic targets in stroke research, we need to understand the influence of hypertension in the vasculature following stroke. We used Affymetrix whole-transcriptome expression profiling as a tool to address gene expression differences between the occluded and non-occluded middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO), to provide clues about the pathological mechanisms set in play after stroke. Verified by quantitative PCR, expression of Ccl2, Edn1, Tgfβ2, Olr1 and Serpine1 was significantly increased in the occluded compared to non-occluded MCAs from both SHRs and WKY rats. Additionally, expression of Mmp9, Icam1, Hif1α and Timp1 was increased in the occluded compared to non-occluded MCAs isolated from WKY rats. In comparison between occluded MCAs from SHRs versus occluded MCAs from WKY rats, expression of Ccl2, Olr1 and Serpine1 was significantly increased in SHR MCAs. However, the opposite was observed regarding expression of Edn1. Thus these data suggest that Ccl2, Edn1, Tgfβ2, Olr1 and Serpine1 may be possible mediators of the vascular changes in the occluded MCAs from both SHRs and WKY rats after tMCAO. The aforementioned genes possess biological functions that are consistent with early stroke injuries. In conclusion, these genes may be potential targets in future strategies for acute stroke treatments that can be used in patients with and without hypertension.},

Several agents have been suggested as being responsible; amongst these perhaps 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) are the most prominent given their ability to elicit powerful constriction of cerebral arteries. Investigating both 5-HT and ET receptors we have observed that there are distinct changes in receptor phenotype after experimental SAH, namely upregulation of the ETB and 5-HT1B receptors, and that this upregulation is linked to a higher sensitivity to the endogenous agonists. It has also been shown that reduction in regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is associated with receptor upregulation and interventional animal experiments have shown a benefit from inhibiting the PKC and MAP kinase pathways on receptor upregulation, CBF and neurological outcome.},

   abstract = {Cerebral ischemia that develops after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) carries high morbidity and mortality. Inflammatory mediators are involved in the development of cerebral ischemia through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. We hypothesized that blockade of the MAPkinase/ERK (MEK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway upstream with a specific raf inhibitor would prevent SAH-induced activation of the cerebrovascular inflammatory response. The raf inhibitor SB-386023-b was injected intracisternally in our rat model at 0, 6, or 12 hours after the SAH. After 48 hours, cerebral arteries were harvested, and iNOS, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were investigated by immunofluorescence, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Western blot analysis. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) was measured using autoradiography. Protein levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1, iNOS, IL-6, and IL-1β were increased after SAH, as were mRNA levels of IL-6, MMP-9, and TIMP-1. After SAH, pERK1/2 was increased, but CBF was reduced. Treatment with SB-386023-b at 0 or 6 hours after SAH normalized CBF and prevented SAH-induced upregulation of MMPs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pERK1/2 proteins. These results suggested that inhibition of MEK/ERK signal transduction by a specific raf inhibitor administered up to 6 hours after SAH normalized the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators and extracellular matrix-related genes.},

   abstract = {Some degree of spontaneous recovery is usually observed after stroke. Experimental studies have provided information about molecular mechanisms underlying this recovery. However, the majority of pre-clinical stroke studies are performed in male rodents, and females are not well studied. This is a clear discrepancy when considering the clinical situation. Thus, it is important to include females in the evaluation of recovery mechanisms for future therapeutic strategies. This study aimed to evaluate spontaneous recovery and molecular mechanisms involved in the recovery phase two weeks after stroke in female rats.|Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion was induced in female Wistar rats using a filament model. Neurological functions were assessed up to day 14 after stroke. Protein expression of interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, neuronal specific nuclei protein (NeuN), nestin, tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie-2, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and Akt were evaluated in the peri-infarct and ischemic core compared to contralateral side of the brain at day 14 by western blot. Expression of TGF-β in middle cerebral arteries was evaluated by immunohistochemistry.|Spontaneous recovery after stroke was observed from day 2 to day 14 and was accompanied by a significantly higher expression of nestin, p-Akt, p-ERK1/2 and TGF-β in ischemic regions compared to contralateral side at day 14. In addition, a significantly higher expression of TGF-β was observed in occluded versus non-occluded middle cerebral arteries. The expression of Tie-2 and IL-10 did not differ between the ischemic and contralateral sides.|Spontaneous recovery after ischemic stroke in female rats was coincided by a difference observed in the expression of molecular markers. The alteration of these markers might be of importance to address future therapeutic strategies.},

   abstract = {In acute ischemic stroke, the only FDA-approved drug; recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is limited by restricted time-window due to an enhanced risk of hemorrhagic transformation which is thought to be caused by metalloproteinase (MMP). In experimental stroke inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 pathways reduce the MMPs. This study evaluated whether a MEK1/2 inhibitor in combination with rt-PA can prevent the detrimental effects of delayed rt-PA therapy in stroke. Thromboembolic stroke was induced in C57 black/6J mice and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was administrated 3.5 h and rt-PA 4 h post stroke-onset. Treatment with rt-PA demonstrated enhanced MMP-9 protein levels and hemorrhagic transformation which was prevented when U0126 was given in conjunction with rt-PA. By blocking the MMP-9 with U0126 the safety of rt-PA administration was improved and demonstrates a promising adjuvant strategy to reduce the harmful effects of delayed rt-PA treatment in acute ischemic stroke.},

   abstract = {The debate over the fact that experimental drugs proposed for the treatment of stroke fail in the translation to the clinical situation has attracted considerable attention in the literature. In this context, we present a retrospective pooled analysis of a large data set from preclinical studies, to examine the effects of early versus late administration of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator.|We collected data from 26 individual studies from 9 international centers (13 researchers; 716 animals) that compared recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator with controls, in a unique mouse model of thromboembolic stroke induced by an in situ injection of thrombin into the middle cerebral artery. Studies were classified into early (<3 hours) versus late (≥3 hours) drug administration. Final infarct volumes, assessed by histology or magnetic resonance imaging, were compared in each study, and the absolute differences were pooled in a random-effect meta-analysis. The influence of time of administration was tested.|When compared with saline controls, early recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator administration was associated with a significant benefit (absolute difference, -6.63 mm(3); 95% confidence interval, -9.08 to -4.17; I(2)=76%), whereas late recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator treatment showed a deleterious effect (+5.06 mm(3); 95% confidence interval, +2.78 to +7.34; I(2)=42%; Pint<0.00001). Results remained unchanged after subgroup analyses.|Our results provide the basis needed for the design of future preclinical studies on recanalization therapies using this model of thromboembolic stroke in mice. The power analysis reveals that a multicenter trial would require 123 animals per group instead of 40 for a single-center trial.},

   abstract = {Women account for 60% of all stroke deaths and are more often permanently disabled than men, despite their higher observed stroke incidence. Considering the clinical population affected by stroke, an obvious drawback is that many pre-clinical and clinical studies only investigate young males. To improve therapeutic translation from bench to bedside, we believe that it is advantageous to include both sexes in experimental models of stroke. The aims of this study were to identify early cerebral vascular responses to ischemic stroke in females, compare the differential gene expression patterns with those seen in males, and identify potential new therapeutic targets.|Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO) was used to induce stroke in both female and male rats, the middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) were isolated 3 h post reperfusion and RNA was extracted. Affymetrix whole transcriptome expression profiling was performed on female (n = 12) MCAs to reveal differentially expressed genes. In total, 1076 genes had an increased expression and 879 genes a decreased expression in the occluded MCAs as compared with the control MCAs from female rats. An enrichment of genes related to apoptosis, regulation of transcription, protein autophosphorylation, inflammation, oxidative stress, and tissue repair and recovery were seen in the occluded MCA. The high expression genes chosen for qPCR verification (Adamts4, Olr1, JunB, Fosl1, Serpine1, S1pr3, Ccl2 and Socs3) were all shown to be upregulated in the same manner in both females and males after tMCAO (p < 0.05; n = 23). When comparing the differentially expressed genes in female MCAs (occluded and non-occluded) with our previous findings in males after tMCAO, a total of 297 genes overlapped (all groups had 32 genes in common).|The cascades of processes initiated in the vasculature following reperfusion are complex. Dynamic gene expression alterations were observed in the occluded MCAs, and to a less pronounced degree in the non-occluded MCAs. Dysregulation of inflammation and blood-brain barrier breakdown are possible pharmacological targets. The sample of genes (< 1% of the differentially expressed genes) validated for this microarray did not reveal any sex differences. However, sex differences might be observed for other gene targets.},

   abstract = {Organ culture is an in vitro method for investigating cellular mechanisms involved in upregulation of vasocontractile G-protein coupled receptors. We hypothesize that mitogen-activated-protein kinase (MEK) and/or extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) specific inhibitors will attenuate the G-protein coupled receptor expression following organ culture. Rat cerebral arteries were incubated 48h in the presence of MEK/ERK specific inhibitors U0126, PD98059, SL327, or AG126 for different time periods. Contractile responses by activation of endothelin receptor type A and type B, serotonin receptor 5-HT(1B), prostanoid TP receptor, and angiotensin II receptor type 1 and type 2 were investigated. Results were verified by measurement of mRNA with real time PCR and by protein immunohistochemistry. Organ culture induced transcriptional upregulation of endothelin ET(B) receptor and of serotonin 5-HT(1B) receptor on translational level and increased respective contractions. The prostanoid TP receptor mediated contraction curve was left-wards shifted by organ culture. Organ culture was associated with elevated pERK1/2 in the vascular smooth muscle cells: the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 attenuated the endothelin ET(B) receptor mediated contraction at post-translational level or by changing the receptor affinities. The serotonin 5-HT(1B) receptor and prostanoid TP receptor mediated contractions were abolished by U0126. Administration of U0126 6h after start of incubation blocked the receptor upregulation. In conclusion, MEK specific inhibitor U0126 is a potent inhibitor of G-protein coupled receptor alteration seen during organ culture. Given the ability to inhibit G-protein coupled receptor alteration at the clinically relevant time-point 6h post incubation makes it an attractive therapeutic agent for in vivo studies.},

In the present study, the authors evaluated the time course and sequence of the transduction pathways, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and associated transcription factor activation as well as gene regulation and associated protein levels.|Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced in rats by injecting 250 microl of blood into the suprachiasmatic cistern, and gene regulation in the cerebral arteries was examined at various points in time following SAH by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry.|Immunohistochemical findings demonstrated that SAH phosphorylates and activates p38 and ERK1/2 as well as the downstream transcription factors Elk-1 and activating transcription factor-2. The pattern of activation consists of a rapid phase within the first few hours and a late phase that occurs from 24 to 48 hours. Activation is followed by an increase in the transcription of the inflammatory and ECM-related genes (IL6, TNFalpha, IL1beta, CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, MMP8, MMP9, MMP13, and iNOS), as demonstrated using real-time PCR. For MMP13 and iNOS, the changes in transcription were translated into functional proteins, as revealed on immunohistochemistry.|Activation of the p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and their downstream transcription factors can explain the increase in the transcription of the genes studied. This increase and the subsequent augmentation in protein levels suggest that the inflammatory response may in part explain the remodeling that occurs in cerebral arteries following SAH.},

We hypothesise that the expression of inflammatory genes (Il6, iNOS, cxcl2, TNF-alpha and Il-1beta) and extracellular-matrix-related genes (MMP9, MMP13) is induced in cerebral arteries following cerebral ischemia via activation of mitogen activated kinases (MAPKs). This hypothesis was tested in vivo by experimental subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH) and temporal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), and by organ culture of isolated cerebral arteries with quantitative real time PCR (mRNA expression) and immunohistochemistry (localization of protein expression). The gene promoters were investigated in silica with computer analysis. The mRNA analysis revealed that the ischemic models, SAH and MCAO, as well as organ culture of isolated cerebral arteries resulted in transcriptional upregulation of the abovementioned genes. The protein expression involved phosphorylation of three different MAPKs signalling pathways (p38, ERK 1/2 and SAPK/JNK) and the downstream transcription factors (ATF-2, Elk-1, c-Jun) shown by immunohistochemistry and quantified by image analysis. All three models revealed the same pattern of activation in the cerebrovascular smooth muscle cells. The in silica analysis demonstrated binding sites for said transcription factors. The results suggest that cerebral ischemia and organ culture induce activation of p38, ERK 1/2 and SAPK/JNK in cerebral arteries which in turn activate the transcription factors ATF-2, Elk-1 and c-Jun and the expression of inflammatory and extracellular-matrix-related genes in the wall of cerebral arteries.},

Normal ²³Na was detected in hypoperfused stroke tissue which exhibited a low ¹H apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and no changes in ¹H T₂ relaxation time during transient ischemia, while ²³Na increased and ADC values recovered to normal values directly after arterial reperfusion. For the first time, a similar imaging protocol was set-up on a clinical 3T MRI site in conjunction with a commercial double-tuned ¹H/²³Na birdcage resonator avoiding a time-consuming exchange of resonators or MRI systems. Multinuclear ²³Na/¹H MRI data sets were obtained from one stroke patient during both the acute and non-acute stroke phases with an aquisition time of 22 min. The lesion exhibiting low ADC was found to be larger compared to the lesion with high ²³Na at 9 h after symptom onset. It is hoped that the presented pilot data demonstrate that fast multinuclear ²³Na/¹H MRI preclinical and clinical protocols can enable a better understanding of how temporal and regional MRI parameter changes link to pathophysiological variations in ischemic stroke tissue.},

However, reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-considered a marker of tissue damage-was observed to reverse spontaneously during the subacute stroke phase (24-72 h) which means that low ADC cannot be used to reflect the damaged tissue after 24 h in experimental and clinical studies. One reason for the change in ADC is that ADC values drop with cytotoxic edema (acute phase) and rise when vasogenic edema begins (subacute phase). Recently, combined|Sodium signal in core did not change before reperfusion, increased after reperfusion while sodium signal in penumbra was significantly reduced before reperfusion, but showed no changes after reperfusion compared to control. The ADC was significantly decreased in core tissue at all three time points compared to contralateral side. This decrease recovered above commonly applied viability thresholds in the core after 24 h.|Reduced sodium-MRI signal in conjunction with reduced ADC can serve as a viability marker for penumbra detection and complement hydrogen diffusion- and perfusion-MRI in order to facilitate time-independent assessment of tissue fate and cellular bioenergetics failure in stroke patients.},

   abstract = {Cerebellar dysfunction is commonly observed following traumatic brain injury (TBI). While direct impact to the cerebellum by TBI is rare, cerebellar pathology may be caused by indirect injury via cortico-cerebellar pathways. To address the hypothesis that degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs), which constitute the sole output from the cerebellum, is linked to long-range axonal injury and demyelination, we used the central fluid percussion injury (cFPI) model of widespread traumatic axonal injury in mice. Compared to controls, TBI resulted in early PC loss accompanied by alterations in the size of pinceau synapses and levels of non-phosphorylated neurofilament in PCs. A combination of vDISCO tissue clearing technique and immunohistochemistry for vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 show that diffuse TBI decreased mossy and climbing fiber synapses on PCs. At 2 days post-injury, numerous axonal varicosities were found in the cerebellum supported by fractional anisotropy measurements using 9.4 T MRI. The disruption and demyelination of the cortico-cerebellar circuits was associated with poor performance of brain-injured mice in the beam-walk test. Despite a lack of direct input from the injury site to the cerebellum, these findings argue for novel long-range mechanisms causing Purkinje cell injury that likely contribute to cerebellar dysfunction after TBI.},
