abstract: Cerebral ischemia that develops after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) carries
  high morbidity and mortality. Inflammatory mediators are involved in the development
  of cerebral ischemia through activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  pathway. We hypothesized that blockade of the MAPkinase/ERK (MEK)/extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway upstream with a specific raf inhibitor would
  prevent SAH-induced activation of the cerebrovascular inflammatory response. The
  raf inhibitor SB-386023-b was injected intracisternally in our rat model at 0, 6,
  or 12 hours after the SAH. After 48 hours, cerebral arteries were harvested, and
  iNOS, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, tissue inhibitors
  of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1, and phosphorylated ERK1/2 were investigated by immunofluorescence,
  real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and Western blot analysis. Cerebral blood
  flow (CBF) was measured using autoradiography. Protein levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1,
  iNOS, IL-6, and IL-1β were increased after SAH, as were mRNA levels of IL-6, MMP-9,
  and TIMP-1. After SAH, pERK1/2 was increased, but CBF was reduced. Treatment with
  SB-386023-b at 0 or 6 hours after SAH normalized CBF and prevented SAH-induced upregulation
  of MMPs, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and pERK1/2 proteins. These results suggested
  that inhibition of MEK/ERK signal transduction by a specific raf inhibitor administered
  up to 6 hours after SAH normalized the expression of pro-inflammatory mediators
  and extracellular matrix-related genes.
