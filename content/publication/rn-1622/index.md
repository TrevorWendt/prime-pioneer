abstract: Sex differences are well known in cerebral ischemia and may impact the effect
  of stroke treatments. In male rats, the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 reduces ischemia-induced
  endothelin type B (ETB) receptor upregulation, infarct size and improves acute neurologic
  function after experimental stroke. However, responses to this treatment in females
  and long-term effects on outcome are not known. Initial experiments used in vitro
  organ culture of cerebral arteries, confirming ERK1/2 activation and increased ETB
  receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in female cerebral arteries. Transient middle
  cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO, 120 minutes) was induced in female Wistar rats,
  with U0126 (30 mg/kg intraperitoneally) or vehicle administered at 0 and 24 hours
  of reperfusion, or with no treatment. Infarct volumes were determined and neurologic
  function was assessed by 6-point and 28-point neuroscores. ETB receptor-mediated
  contraction was studied with myograph and protein expression with immunohistochemistry.
  In vitro organ culture and tMCAO resulted in vascular ETB receptor upregulation
  and activation of ERK1/2 that was prevented by U0126. Although no effect on infarct
  size, U0126 improved the long-term neurologic function after experimental stroke
  in female rats. In conclusion, early prevention of the ERK1/2 activation and ETB
  receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the cerebral vasculature after ischemic stroke
  in female rats improves the long-term neurologic outcome.
