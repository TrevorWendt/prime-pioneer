abstract: Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) results in the expression of inflammatory
  and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related genes and various G protein-coupled receptors.
  In the present study, the authors evaluated the time course and sequence of the
  transduction pathways, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and extracellular
  signal-regulated kinase-1 and 2 (ERK1/2), and associated transcription factor activation
  as well as gene regulation and associated protein levels.|Subarachnoid hemorrhage
  was induced in rats by injecting 250 microl of blood into the suprachiasmatic cistern,
  and gene regulation in the cerebral arteries was examined at various points in time
  following SAH by using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and immunohistochemistry.|Immunohistochemical
  findings demonstrated that SAH phosphorylates and activates p38 and ERK1/2 as well
  as the downstream transcription factors Elk-1 and activating transcription factor-2.
  The pattern of activation consists of a rapid phase within the first few hours and
  a late phase that occurs from 24 to 48 hours. Activation is followed by an increase
  in the transcription of the inflammatory and ECM-related genes (IL6, TNFalpha, IL1beta,
  CXCL1, CXCL2, CCL20, MMP8, MMP9, MMP13, and iNOS), as demonstrated using real-time
  PCR. For MMP13 and iNOS, the changes in transcription were translated into functional
  proteins, as revealed on immunohistochemistry.|Activation of the p38 and ERK1/2
  signaling pathways and their downstream transcription factors can explain the increase
  in the transcription of the genes studied. This increase and the subsequent augmentation
  in protein levels suggest that the inflammatory response may in part explain the
  remodeling that occurs in cerebral arteries following SAH.
