abstract: 'Cerebral ischemia remains the key cause of disability and death in the
  late phase after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and its pathogenesis is still poorly
  understood. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the change in intracranial
  pressure or the extravasated blood causes the late cerebral ischemia and the upregulation
  of receptors or the cerebral vasoconstriction observed following SAH.|Rats were
  allocated to 1 of 3 experimental conditions: 1) cisternal injection of 250 microl
  blood (SAH Group), 2) cisternal injection of 250 microl NaCl (Saline Group), or
  3) the same procedure but without fluid injection (Sham Group). Two days after the
  procedure, the basilar and middle cerebral arteries were harvested, and contractile
  responses to endothelin (ET)-1 and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) were investigated
  by means of myography. In addition, real-time polymerase chain reaction was used
  to determine the mRNA levels for ET(A), ET(B), and 5-HT(1) receptors. Regional and
  global cerebral blood flow (CBF) were quantified by means of an autoradiographic
  technique.|Compared with the sham condition, both SAH and saline injection resulted
  in significantly enhanced contraction of cerebral arteries in response to ET-1 and
  5-CT. Regional and global CBF were reduced both in the Saline and SAH groups compared
  with the Sham Group. The mRNA levels for ET(B) and 5-HT(1B) receptors were upregulated
  after SAH and saline injection compared with the sham procedure. The effects in
  all parameters were more pronounced for SAH than for saline injection.|This study
  revealed that both the elevation of intracranial pressure and subarachnoid blood
  per se contribute approximately equally to the late CBF reductions and receptor
  upregulation following SAH.'
