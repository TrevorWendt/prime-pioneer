abstract: The debate over the fact that experimental drugs proposed for the treatment
  of stroke fail in the translation to the clinical situation has attracted considerable
  attention in the literature. In this context, we present a retrospective pooled
  analysis of a large data set from preclinical studies, to examine the effects of
  early versus late administration of intravenous recombinant tissue-type plasminogen
  activator.|We collected data from 26 individual studies from 9 international centers
  (13 researchers; 716 animals) that compared recombinant tissue-type plasminogen
  activator with controls, in a unique mouse model of thromboembolic stroke induced
  by an in situ injection of thrombin into the middle cerebral artery. Studies were
  classified into early (<3 hours) versus late (≥3 hours) drug administration. Final
  infarct volumes, assessed by histology or magnetic resonance imaging, were compared
  in each study, and the absolute differences were pooled in a random-effect meta-analysis.
  The influence of time of administration was tested.|When compared with saline controls,
  early recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator administration was associated
  with a significant benefit (absolute difference, -6.63 mm(3); 95% confidence interval,
  -9.08 to -4.17; I(2)=76%), whereas late recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator
  treatment showed a deleterious effect (+5.06 mm(3); 95% confidence interval, +2.78
  to +7.34; I(2)=42%; Pint<0.00001). Results remained unchanged after subgroup analyses.|Our
  results provide the basis needed for the design of future preclinical studies on
  recanalization therapies using this model of thromboembolic stroke in mice. The
  power analysis reveals that a multicenter trial would require 123 animals per group
  instead of 40 for a single-center trial.
