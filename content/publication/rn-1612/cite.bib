 abstract = {Ischemia, both in the form of focal thromboembolic stroke and following subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), causes upregulation of vasoconstrictive receptor systems within the cerebral vasculature. Descriptions regarding changes in purinergic signaling following ischemia are lacking, especially when the importance of purinergic signaling in regulating vascular tone is taken into consideration. This prompted us to evaluate changes in P2Y},
