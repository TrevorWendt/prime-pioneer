abstract: In acute ischemic stroke, the only FDA-approved drug; recombinant tissue
  plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is limited by restricted time-window due to an enhanced
  risk of hemorrhagic transformation which is thought to be caused by metalloproteinase
  (MMP). In experimental stroke inhibitors of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
  kinase extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) 1/2 pathways reduce the
  MMPs. This study evaluated whether a MEK1/2 inhibitor in combination with rt-PA
  can prevent the detrimental effects of delayed rt-PA therapy in stroke. Thromboembolic
  stroke was induced in C57 black/6J mice and the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126 was administrated
  3.5 h and rt-PA 4 h post stroke-onset. Treatment with rt-PA demonstrated enhanced
  MMP-9 protein levels and hemorrhagic transformation which was prevented when U0126
  was given in conjunction with rt-PA. By blocking the MMP-9 with U0126 the safety
  of rt-PA administration was improved and demonstrates a promising adjuvant strategy
  to reduce the harmful effects of delayed rt-PA treatment in acute ischemic stroke.
