abstract: Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the current-state-of-the-art
  technique to clinically investigate acute (0-24 h) ischemic stroke tissue. However,
  reduced apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)-considered a marker of tissue damage-was
  observed to reverse spontaneously during the subacute stroke phase (24-72 h) which
  means that low ADC cannot be used to reflect the damaged tissue after 24 h in experimental
  and clinical studies. One reason for the change in ADC is that ADC values drop with
  cytotoxic edema (acute phase) and rise when vasogenic edema begins (subacute phase).
  Recently, combined|Sodium signal in core did not change before reperfusion, increased
  after reperfusion while sodium signal in penumbra was significantly reduced before
  reperfusion, but showed no changes after reperfusion compared to control. The ADC
  was significantly decreased in core tissue at all three time points compared to
  contralateral side. This decrease recovered above commonly applied viability thresholds
  in the core after 24 h.|Reduced sodium-MRI signal in conjunction with reduced ADC
  can serve as a viability marker for penumbra detection and complement hydrogen diffusion-
  and perfusion-MRI in order to facilitate time-independent assessment of tissue fate
  and cellular bioenergetics failure in stroke patients.
