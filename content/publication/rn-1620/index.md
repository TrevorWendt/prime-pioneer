abstract: To estimate changes in the (23)Na density and in the (23)Na relaxation time
  T(2) * in the anatomically small murine brain after stroke.|Three-dimensional acquisition
  weighted chemical shift imaging at a resolution of 0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 mm(3) was used
  for sodium imaging and relaxation parameter mapping. In vivo measurements of the
  mouse brain (n = 4) were performed 24 hours after stroke, induced by microinjection
  of purified murine thrombin into the right middle cerebral artery. The measurement
  time was 14 minutes in one mouse and 65 minutes in the other three. An exponential
  fit estimation of the free induction decay was calculated for each voxel enabling
  the reconstruction of locally resolved relaxation parameter maps.|The infarcted
  areas showed an increase in sodium density between 160% and 250%, while the T(2)
  * relaxation time increased by 5%-72% compared to unaffected contralateral brain
  tissue.|(23)Na chemical shift imaging at a resolution of 0.6 × 0.6 × 1.2 mm(3) enabled
  sodium imaging of the anatomical small mouse brain and the acquired data allowed
  calculating relaxation parameter maps and hence a more exact evaluation of sodium
  signal changes after stroke.
