abstract: Hypertension is a major risk factor for stroke, which is one of the leading
  global causes of death. In the search for new and effective therapeutic targets
  in stroke research, we need to understand the influence of hypertension in the vasculature
  following stroke. We used Affymetrix whole-transcriptome expression profiling as
  a tool to address gene expression differences between the occluded and non-occluded
  middle cerebral arteries (MCAs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and
  normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion
  (tMCAO), to provide clues about the pathological mechanisms set in play after stroke.
  Verified by quantitative PCR, expression of Ccl2, Edn1, Tgfβ2, Olr1 and Serpine1
  was significantly increased in the occluded compared to non-occluded MCAs from both
  SHRs and WKY rats. Additionally, expression of Mmp9, Icam1, Hif1α and Timp1 was
  increased in the occluded compared to non-occluded MCAs isolated from WKY rats.
  In comparison between occluded MCAs from SHRs versus occluded MCAs from WKY rats,
  expression of Ccl2, Olr1 and Serpine1 was significantly increased in SHR MCAs. However,
  the opposite was observed regarding expression of Edn1. Thus these data suggest
  that Ccl2, Edn1, Tgfβ2, Olr1 and Serpine1 may be possible mediators of the vascular
  changes in the occluded MCAs from both SHRs and WKY rats after tMCAO. The aforementioned
  genes possess biological functions that are consistent with early stroke injuries.
  In conclusion, these genes may be potential targets in future strategies for acute
  stroke treatments that can be used in patients with and without hypertension.
