 abstract = {Stroke is one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and few therapeutic treatments have shown beneficial effect clinically. One reason for this could be the lack of risk factors incorporated into the preclinical stroke research. We have previously demonstrated phenotypic receptor changes to be one of the injurious mechanisms occurring after stroke but mostly in healthy rats. The aim of this study was to investigate if hypertension has an effect on vasoconstrictive receptor responses to endothelin 1, sarafotoxin 6c and angiotensin II after stroke by inducing transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in spontaneously hypertensive rats and Wistar-Kyoto rats using the wire-myograph. We demonstrated an increased contractile response to endothelin 1 and extracellular potassium as well as an increased carbachol-induced dilator response in the middle cerebral arteries from hypertensive rats after stroke. This study demonstrates the importance of including risk factors in experimental stroke research.},
