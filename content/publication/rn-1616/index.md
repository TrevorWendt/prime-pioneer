abstract: Cerebellar dysfunction is commonly observed following traumatic brain injury
  (TBI). While direct impact to the cerebellum by TBI is rare, cerebellar pathology
  may be caused by indirect injury via cortico-cerebellar pathways. To address the
  hypothesis that degeneration of Purkinje cells (PCs), which constitute the sole
  output from the cerebellum, is linked to long-range axonal injury and demyelination,
  we used the central fluid percussion injury (cFPI) model of widespread traumatic
  axonal injury in mice. Compared to controls, TBI resulted in early PC loss accompanied
  by alterations in the size of pinceau synapses and levels of non-phosphorylated
  neurofilament in PCs. A combination of vDISCO tissue clearing technique and immunohistochemistry
  for vesicular glutamate transporter type 2 show that diffuse TBI decreased mossy
  and climbing fiber synapses on PCs. At 2 days post-injury, numerous axonal varicosities
  were found in the cerebellum supported by fractional anisotropy measurements using
  9.4 T MRI. The disruption and demyelination of the cortico-cerebellar circuits was
  associated with poor performance of brain-injured mice in the beam-walk test. Despite
  a lack of direct input from the injury site to the cerebellum, these findings argue
  for novel long-range mechanisms causing Purkinje cell injury that likely contribute
  to cerebellar dysfunction after TBI.
