abstract: Elevated plasma levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) are a
  risk factor and key component that accelerates and worsens cardiovascular disease
  fueling inflammation, plaque buildup and vascular damage. OxLDL can elicit its detrimental
  action via lectin-like oxLDL receptor 1 (LOX-1). In this study, we determined whether
  oxLDL, via LOX-1, alters aortic vascular reactivity and determined if sex and age
  differences exist. Thoracic aortic endothelium-intact or -denuded ring segments
  were isolated from 7 to 12Â months old intact C57BL/6J female and male mice and pre-incubated
  with oxLDL
