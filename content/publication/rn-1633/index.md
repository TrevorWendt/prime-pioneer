abstract: Late cerebral ischemia carries high morbidity and mortality after subarachnoid
  hemorrhage (SAH) due to reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and the subsequent cerebral
  ischemia which is associated with upregulation of contractile receptors in the vascular
  smooth muscle cells (SMC) via activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
  of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 signal pathway. We hypothesize
  that SAH initiates cerebrovascular ERK1/2 activation, resulting in receptor upregulation.
  The raf inhibitor will inhibit the molecular events upstream ERK1/2 and may provide
  a therapeutic window for treatment of cerebral ischemia after SAH.|Here we demonstrate
  that SAH increases the phosphorylation level of ERK1/2 in cerebral vessels and reduces
  the neurology score in rats in additional with the CBF measured by an autoradiographic
  method. The intracisternal administration of SB-386023-b, a specific inhibitor of
  raf, given 6 h after SAH, aborts the receptor changes and protects the brain from
  the development of late cerebral ischemia at 48 h. This is accompanied by reduced
  phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in cerebrovascular SMC. SAH per se enhances contractile
  responses to endothelin-1 (ET-1), 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) and angiotensin
  II (Ang II), upregulates ETB, 5-HT1B and AT1 receptor mRNA and protein levels. Treatment
  with SB-386023-b given as late as at 6 h but not at 12 h after the SAH significantly
  decreased the receptor upregulation, the reduction in CBF and the neurology score.|These
  results provide evidence for a role of the ERK1/2 pathway in regulation of expression
  of cerebrovascular SMC receptors. It is suggested that raf inhibition may reduce
  late cerebral ischemia after SAH and provides a realistic time window for therapy.
