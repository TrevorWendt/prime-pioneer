abstract: Acute ischemic stroke triggers endothelial activation that disrupts vascular
  integrity and increases hemorrhagic transformation leading to worsened stroke outcomes.
  rt-PA (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator) is an effective treatment;
  however, its use is limited due to a restricted time window and hemorrhagic transformation
  risk, which in part may involve activation of MMPs (matrix metalloproteinases) mediated
  through LOX-1 (lectin-like oxLDL [oxidized low-density lipoprotein] receptor 1).
  This study's overall aim was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of novel MMP-9
  (matrix metalloproteinase 9) ± LOX-1 inhibitors in combination with rt-PA to improve
  stroke outcomes.|A rat thromboembolic stroke model was utilized to investigate the
  impact of rt-PA delivered 4 hours poststroke onset as well as selective MMP-9 (JNJ0966)
  ±LOX-1 (BI-0115) inhibitors given before rt-PA administration. Infarct size, perfusion,
  and hemorrhagic transformation were evaluated by 9.4-T magnetic resonance imaging,
  vascular and parenchymal MMP-9 activity via zymography, and neurological function
  was assessed using sensorimotor function testing. Human brain microvascular endothelial
  cells were exposed to hypoxia plus glucose deprivation/reperfusion (hypoxia plus
  glucose deprivation 3 hours/R 24 hours) and treated with ±tPA and ±MMP-9 ±LOX-1
  inhibitors. Barrier function was assessed via transendothelial electrical resistance,
  MMP-9 activity was determined with zymography, and LOX-1 and barrier gene expression/levels
  were measured using qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription PCR) and Western
  blot.|Stroke and subsequent rt-PA treatment increased edema, hemorrhage, MMP-9 activity,
  LOX-1 expression, and worsened neurological outcomes. LOX-1 inhibition improved
  neurological function, reduced edema, and improved endothelial barrier integrity.
  Elevated MMP-9 activity correlated with increased edema, infarct volume, and decreased
  neurological function. MMP-9 inhibition reduced MMP-9 activity and LOX-1 expression.
  In human brain microvascular endothelial cells, LOX-1/MMP-9 inhibition differentially
  attenuated MMP-9 levels, inflammation, and activation following hypoxia plus glucose
  deprivation/R.|Our findings indicate that LOX-1 inhibition and ± MMP-9 inhibition
  attenuate negative aspects of ischemic stroke with rt-PA therapy, thus resulting
  in improved neurological function. While no synergistic effect was observed with
  simultaneous LOX-1 and MMP-9 inhibition, a distinct interaction is evident.
