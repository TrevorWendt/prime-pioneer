abstract: For many years, delivering drug molecules across the blood brain barrier
  has been a major challenge. The neuropeptide nerve growth factor is involved in
  the regulation of growth and differentiation of cholinergic neurons and holds great
  potential in the treatment of stroke. However, as with many other compounds, the
  biomolecule is not able to enter the central nervous system. In the present study,
  nerve growth factor and ultra-small particles of iron oxide were co-encapsulated
  into a chemically crosslinked albumin nanocarrier matrix which was modified on the
  surface with apolipoprotein E. These biodegradable nanoparticles with a size of
  212 ± 1 nm exhibited monodisperse size distribution and low toxicity. They delivered
  NGF through an artificial blood brain barrier and were able to induce neurite outgrowth
  in PC12 cells in vitro. In an animal model of stroke, the infarct size was significantly
  reduced compared to the vehicle control. The combination therapy of NGF and the
  small-molecular MEK inhibitor U0126 showed a slight but not significant difference
  compared to U0126 alone. However, further in vivo evidence suggests that successful
  delivery of the neuropeptide is possible as well as the synergism between those
  two treatments.
