abstract: Tissues from males can be regulated by a balance of androgenic and estrogenic
  effects because of local metabolism of testosterone and expression of relevant steroid
  hormone receptors. As a critical first step to understanding sex hormone influences
  in the cerebral circulation of males, we investigated the presence of enzymes that
  metabolize testosterone to active products and their respective receptors. We found
  that cerebral blood vessels from male rats express 5alpha-reductase type 2 and aromatase,
  enzymes responsible for conversion of testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT)
  and 17beta-estradiol, respectively. Protein levels of these enzymes, however, were
  not modulated by long-term in vivo hormone treatment. We also showed the presence
  of receptors for both androgens (AR) and estrogens (ER) from male cerebral vessels.
  Western blot analysis showed bands corresponding to the full-length AR (110 kDa)
  and ERalpha (66 kDa). Long-term in vivo treatment of orchiectomized rats with testosterone
  or DHT, but not estrogen, increased AR levels in cerebral vessels. In contrast,
  ERalpha protein levels were increased after in vivo treatment with estrogen but
  not testosterone. Fluorescent immunostaining revealed ERalpha, AR, and 5alpha-reductase
  type 2 in both the endothelial and smooth muscle layers of cerebral arteries, whereas
  aromatase staining was solely localized to the endothelium. Thus, cerebral vessels
  from males are target tissues for both androgens and estrogen. Furthermore, local
  metabolism of testosterone might balance opposing androgenic and estrogenic influences
  on cerebrovascular as well as brain function in males.
