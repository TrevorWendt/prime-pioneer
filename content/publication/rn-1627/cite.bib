 abstract = {The recent clinical trial (DAWN) suggests that recanalization treatment may be beneficial up to 24 h after stroke onset, thus re-opening avenues for development of new therapeutic strategies. Unfortunately, there is a continuous failure of drugs in clinical trials and one of the major reasons proposed for this translational roadblock is the animal models. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to validate a new thromboembolic stroke rat model that mimics the human pathology, and that can be used for evaluating new strategies to save the brain in conditions compatible with recanalization. Stroke was induced by injection of thrombin into the middle cerebral artery. Recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) or saline was administrated at 1 h/4 h after stroke onset, and outcome was evaluated after 24 h. Induced ischemia resulted in reproducible cortical brain injuries causing a decrease in neurological function 24 h after stroke onset. Early rt-PA treatment resulted in recanalization, reduced infarct size and improved neurological functions, while late rt-PA treatment showed no beneficial effects and caused hemorrhagic transformation in 25% of the rats. This validated and established model's resemblance to human ischemic stroke and high translational potential, makes it an important tool in the development of new therapeutic strategies for stroke.},
