abstract: Axonal injuries commonly contribute to poor functional outcomes following
  traumatic brain injury (TBI). To assess cerebral blood flow (CBF) and energy metabolic
  disturbances in a TBI model of widespread axonal injury, we exposed 105 adult mice
  to the central (midline) fluid percussion injury (cFPI) diffuse TBI model, or sham
  injury, and used 9.4 T magnetic resonance (MR) arterial spin labeling (ASL), cortical
  and hippocampal mitochondrial respiration, and hippocampal MR spectroscopy at 1-
  and 7-days post-injury (dpi). Widespread, bilateral CBF reductions were observed
  at day 1 dpi, changes that were normalized by 7 dpi. However, cortical and hippocampal
  mitochondrial respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was not significantly
  altered at 1 and 7 dpi. Moreover, hippocampal volumes, evaluated by MRI, were not
  altered by cFPI, and by immunohistochemistry only a few apoptotic hippocampal cells
  were observed. By MRS, evidence of delayed (7 dpi) membrane disruption (phosphocholine
  and glycerophosphocholine) and glutamate/glutamine increase were observed. While
  widespread traumatic axonal pathology associated with functional impairments is
  observed in this TBI model, early CBF alterations were transient and did not translate
  into significant energy metabolic disturbances. Instead, the delayed hippocampal
  metabolite changes observed by MRS may contribute to the functional impairment observed
  in this diffuse TBI model.
