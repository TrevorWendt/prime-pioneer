abstract: Cerebral ischemia results in enhanced expression of contractile cerebrovascular
  receptors, such as endothelin type B (ET(B)), 5-hydroxytryptamine type 1B (5-HT(1B)),
  angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) and thromboxane (TP) receptors in the cerebral arteries
  within the ischemic area. The receptor upregulation occurs via activation of the
  mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) pathway. Previous studies have shown that
  inhibitors of the MAPK pathway diminished the ischemic area and contractile cerebrovascular
  receptors after experimental cerebral ischemia. The aim of this study was to examine
  if the upregulation of contractile cerebrovascular receptors after 48 h of organ
  culture of human cerebral arteries involves MAPK pathways and if it can be prevented
  by a MEK1/2 inhibitor. Human cerebral arteries were obtained from patients undergoing
  intracranial tumor surgery. The vessels were divided into ring segments and incubated
  for 48 h in the presence or absence of the specific MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. The
  vessels were then examined by using in vitro pharmacological methods and protein
  immunohistochemistry.|After organ culture of the cerebral arteries the contractile
  responses to endothelin (ET)-1, angiotensin (Ang) II and thromboxane (TP) were enhanced
  in comparison with fresh human arteries. However, 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT)
  induced decreased contractile responses after organ culture as compared to fresh
  arteries. Incubation with U0126 diminished the maximum contraction elicited by application
  of ET-1, Ang II and U46619 in human cerebral arteries. In addition, the MEK1/2 inhibitor
  decreased the contractile response to 5-CT. Immunohistochemistry revealed that organ
  culture resulted in increased expression of endothelin ET(A), endothelin ET(B) angiotensin
  AT(2), 5-hydroxytryptamine 5-HT(1B) and thromboxane A2 receptors, and elevated levels
  of activated pERK1/2, all localized to the smooth muscle cells of the cerebral arteries.
  Co-incubation with U0126 normalized these proteins.|The study demonstrated that
  there is a clear association between human cerebrovascular receptor upregulation
  via transcription involving activation of the MAPK pathway after organ culture.
  Inhibition of the MAPK pathways attenuated the vasoconstriction mediated by ET,
  AT and TP receptors in human cerebral arteries and the enhanced expression of their
  receptors. The results indicate that MAPK inhibition might be a novel target for
  treatment of cerebrovascular disorders.
